# THREE JS PERSONAL PORTFOLIO
personal portfolio website build in threejs


### Instructions for use (uses Vite https://vitejs.dev/ )
1. The repo has all the built out assets in the top level. To make changes you need to go into the decompiled website/src folder to make modifications. Make sure to npm install to get started
2. Use "npm run dev" to run it locally and test changes
3. To deploy the changes: use "npm run build" to get a dist folder (that has modified js/css/html code in it). These files will need to live in the top level, so copy the files to the right directories (eg assets into assets folder, html where it should be). Could also save src folder to the side, delete everything in the folder, put everything in dist at top level, and then put back the decompiledWebsite/src folder. The assets folder and index.html and models folder all expect to live at the same level, so you'll have to deal with that ig.
4. Push to github and deploy (should be under repo>settings>pages>build and deploy)

Built using vite. To run (this is for forgetfull future me), navigate to src foler and run "npm run dev" which activates vite (after a npm install of course).
