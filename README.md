# AJ's Super Cool Personal Website
### Version 2.0
Most websites are pretty boring... spending 3 hours centering a div so that "The Man" is happy is NOT what I want to do. If modern browsers are supporting WebGl, why not make use of it?

## Built using Three.js and shaders written in GLSL

To Run Locally:
Clone Repo > open folder > npm i > npm run dev <3
Utilizes Vite for runs/builds. See deployment action .github/workflows/action.yml
To deploy simply push up code and trigger github action. Vite packages it all up for you.

Notes (For future AJ):
The 'public' folder holds assets that need to be included, but aren't detected by Vite to include.
