    <p>
      I have my own little slice of the internet here. 

      I won't tell anyone about it

      But here it lives.

      This isn't a poem, the punctuation doent mean anything, just a few words in a completely new order of no real significance. I would rephrase that to put it less cringey, but who cares at the end of the day?

      Please find what you love, and get off the internet for your own sake
